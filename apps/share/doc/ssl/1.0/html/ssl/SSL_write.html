<p>SSL_write - write bytes to a TLS/SSL connection.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<pre>
 #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;</pre>
<pre>
 int SSL_write(SSL *ssl, const void *buf, int num);</pre>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p><code>SSL_write()</code> writes <strong>num</strong> bytes from the buffer <strong>buf</strong> into the specified
<strong>ssl</strong> connection.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="notes">NOTES</a></h1>
<p>If necessary, <code>SSL_write()</code> will negotiate a TLS/SSL session, if
not already explicitly performed by <a href="../ssl/SSL_connect.html">SSL_connect</a> or
<a href="../ssl/SSL_accept.html">SSL_accept</a>. If the
peer requests a re-negotiation, it will be performed transparently during
the <code>SSL_write()</code> operation. The behaviour of <code>SSL_write()</code> depends on the
underlying BIO.</p>
<p>For the transparent negotiation to succeed, the <strong>ssl</strong> must have been
initialized to client or server mode. This is being done by calling
<a href="../ssl/SSL_set_connect_state.html">SSL_set_connect_state</a> or <code>SSL_set_accept_state()</code>
before the first call to an <a href="../ssl/SSL_read.html">SSL_read</a> or <code>SSL_write()</code> function.</p>
<p>If the underlying BIO is <strong>blocking</strong>, <code>SSL_write()</code> will only return, once the
write operation has been finished or an error occurred, except when a
renegotiation take place, in which case a SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ may occur. 
This behaviour can be controlled with the SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY flag of the
<a href="../ssl/SSL_CTX_set_mode.html">SSL_CTX_set_mode</a> call.</p>
<p>If the underlying BIO is <strong>non-blocking</strong>, <code>SSL_write()</code> will also return,
when the underlying BIO could not satisfy the needs of <code>SSL_write()</code>
to continue the operation. In this case a call to
<a href="../ssl/SSL_get_error.html">SSL_get_error</a> with the
return value of <code>SSL_write()</code> will yield <strong>SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ</strong> or
<strong>SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE</strong>. As at any time a re-negotiation is possible, a
call to <code>SSL_write()</code> can also cause read operations! The calling process
then must repeat the call after taking appropriate action to satisfy the
needs of SSL_write(). The action depends on the underlying BIO. When using a
non-blocking socket, nothing is to be done, but <code>select()</code> can be used to check
for the required condition. When using a buffering BIO, like a BIO pair, data
must be written into or retrieved out of the BIO before being able to continue.</p>
<p><code>SSL_write()</code> will only return with success, when the complete contents
of <strong>buf</strong> of length <strong>num</strong> has been written. This default behaviour
can be changed with the SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE option of
<a href="../ssl/SSL_CTX_set_mode.html">SSL_CTX_set_mode</a>. When this flag is set,
<code>SSL_write()</code> will also return with success, when a partial write has been
successfully completed. In this case the <code>SSL_write()</code> operation is considered
completed. The bytes are sent and a new <code>SSL_write()</code> operation with a new
buffer (with the already sent bytes removed) must be started.
A partial write is performed with the size of a message block, which is
16kB for SSLv3/TLSv1.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="warning">WARNING</a></h1>
<p>When an <code>SSL_write()</code> operation has to be repeated because of
<strong>SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ</strong> or <strong>SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE</strong>, it must be repeated
with the same arguments.</p>
<p>When calling <code>SSL_write()</code> with num=0 bytes to be sent the behaviour is
undefined.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="return_values">RETURN VALUES</a></h1>
<p>The following return values can occur:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item__3e0">&gt;0</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>The write operation was successful, the return value is the number of
bytes actually written to the TLS/SSL connection.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<li>
<p>The write operation was not successful. Probably the underlying connection
was closed. Call <code>SSL_get_error()</code> with the return value <strong>ret</strong> to find out,
whether an error occurred or the connection was shut down cleanly
(SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN).</p>
<p>SSLv2 (deprecated) does not support a shutdown alert protocol, so it can
only be detected, whether the underlying connection was closed. It cannot
be checked, why the closure happened.</p>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__3c0">&lt;0</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>The write operation was not successful, because either an error occurred
or action must be taken by the calling process. Call <code>SSL_get_error()</code> with the
return value <strong>ret</strong> to find out the reason.</p>
</dd>
</li>
