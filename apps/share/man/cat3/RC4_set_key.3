       This library implements the Alleged RC4 cipher, which is described for
       example in _A_p_p_l_i_e_d _C_r_y_p_t_o_g_r_a_p_h_y.  It is believed to be compatible with
       RC4[TM], a proprietary cipher of RSA Security Inc.

       RC4 is a stream cipher with variable key length.  Typically, 128 bit
       (16 byte) keys are used for strong encryption, but shorter insecure key
       sizes have been widely used due to export restrictions.

       RC4 consists of a key setup phase and the actual encryption or decryp-
       tion phase.

       _R_C_4___s_e_t___k_e_y_(_) sets up the RRCC44__KKEEYY kkeeyy using the lleenn bytes long key at
       ddaattaa.

       _R_C_4_(_) encrypts or decrypts the lleenn bytes of data at iinnddaattaa using kkeeyy
       and places the result at oouuttddaattaa.  Repeated _R_C_4_(_) calls with the same
       kkeeyy yield a continuous key stream.

       Since RC4 is a stream cipher (the input is XORed with a pseudo-random
       key stream to produce the output), decryption uses the same function
       calls as encryption.

       Applications should use the higher level functions _E_V_P___E_n_c_r_y_p_t_I_n_i_t(3)
       etc. instead of calling the RC4 functions directly.

NNOOTTEE
       Certain conditions have to be observed to securely use stream ciphers.
       It is not permissible to perform multiple encryptions using the same
       key stream.
