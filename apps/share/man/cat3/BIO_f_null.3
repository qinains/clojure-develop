       _B_I_O___f___n_u_l_l_(_) returns the null filter BIO method. This is a filter BIO
       that does nothing.

       All requests to a null filter BIO are passed through to the next BIO in
       the chain: this means that a BIO chain containing a null filter BIO
       behaves just as though the BIO was not there.

NNOOTTEESS
       As may be apparent a null filter BIO is not particularly useful.
