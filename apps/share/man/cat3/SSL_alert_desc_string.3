       When one side of an SSL/TLS communication wants to inform the peer
       about a special situation, it sends an alert. The alert is sent as a
       special message and does not influence the normal data stream (unless
       its contents results in the communication being canceled).

       A warning alert is sent, when a non-fatal error condition occurs. The
       "close notify" alert is sent as a warning alert. Other examples for
       non-fatal errors are certificate errors ("certificate expired", "unsup-
       ported certificate"), for which a warning alert may be sent.  (The
       sending party may however decide to send a fatal error.) The receiving
       side may cancel the connection on reception of a warning alert on it
       discretion.

       Several alert messages must be sent as fatal alert messages as speci-
       fied by the TLS RFC. A fatal alert always leads to a connection abort.

       The following strings can occur for _S_S_L___a_l_e_r_t___t_y_p_e___s_t_r_i_n_g_(_) or

       "W"/"warning"
       "F"/"fatal"
       "U"/"unknown"
           This indicates that no support is available for this alert type.
           Probably vvaalluuee does not contain a correct alert message.

       The following strings can occur for _S_S_L___a_l_e_r_t___d_e_s_c___s_t_r_i_n_g_(_) or

       "CN"/"close notify"
           The connection shall be closed. This is a warning alert.

       "UM"/"unexpected message"
           An inappropriate message was received. This alert is always fatal
           and should never be observed in communication between proper imple-
           mentations.

       "BM"/"bad record mac"
           This alert is returned if a record is received with an incorrect
           MAC. This message is always fatal.

       "DF"/"decompression failure"
           The decompression function received improper input (e.g. data that
           would expand to excessive length). This message is always fatal.

       "HF"/"handshake failure"
           Reception of a handshake_failure alert message indicates that the
           sender was unable to negotiate an acceptable set of security param-
           eters given the options available. This is a fatal error.

       "NC"/"no certificate"
           A client, that was asked to send a certificate, does not send a
           certificate (SSLv3 only).

       "BC"/"bad certificate"
           A certificate was corrupt, contained signatures that did not verify
           correctly, etc

       "UC"/"unsupported certificate"
           A certificate was of an unsupported type.

       "CR"/"certificate revoked"
           A certificate was revoked by its signer.

       "CE"/"certificate expired"
           A certificate has expired or is not currently valid.

       "CU"/"certificate unknown"
           Some other (unspecified) issue arose in processing the certificate,
           rendering it unacceptable.

       "IP"/"illegal parameter"
           A field in the handshake was out of range or inconsistent with
           other fields. This is always fatal.

       "DC"/"decryption failed"
           A TLSCiphertext decrypted in an invalid way: either it wasn't an
           even multiple of the block length or its padding values, when
           checked, weren't correct. This message is always fatal.

       "RO"/"record overflow"
           A TLSCiphertext record was received which had a length more than
           2^14+2048 bytes, or a record decrypted to a TLSCompressed record
           with more than 2^14+1024 bytes. This message is always fatal.

       "CA"/"unknown CA"
           A valid certificate chain or partial chain was received, but the
           certificate was not accepted because the CA certificate could not
           be located or couldn't be matched with a known, trusted CA.  This
           message is always fatal.

       "AD"/"access denied"
           A valid certificate was received, but when access control was
           applied, the sender decided not to proceed with negotiation.  This
           message is always fatal.

       "DE"/"decode error"
           A message could not be decoded because some field was out of the
           specified range or the length of the message was incorrect. This
           message is always fatal.

       "CY"/"decrypt error"
           A handshake cryptographic operation failed, including being unable
           to correctly verify a signature, decrypt a key exchange, or vali-
           date a finished message.

       "ER"/"export restriction"
           A negotiation not in compliance with export restrictions was
           detected; for example, attempting to transfer a 1024 bit ephemeral
           RSA key for the RSA_EXPORT handshake method. This message is always
           fatal.

       "PV"/"protocol version"
           The protocol version the client has attempted to negotiate is rec-
           ognized, but not supported. (For example, old protocol versions
           might be avoided for security reasons). This message is always
           fatal.

       "IS"/"insufficient security"
           Returned instead of handshake_failure when a negotiation has failed
           specifically because the server requires ciphers more secure than
           those supported by the client. This message is always fatal.

       "IE"/"internal error"
           An internal error unrelated to the peer or the correctness of the
           protocol makes it impossible to continue (such as a memory alloca-
           tion failure). This message is always fatal.

       "US"/"user canceled"
           This handshake is being canceled for some reason unrelated to a
           protocol failure. If the user cancels an operation after the hand-
           shake is complete, just closing the connection by sending a
           close_notify is more appropriate. This alert should be followed by
           a close_notify. This message is generally a warning.

       "NR"/"no renegotiation"
           Sent by the client in response to a hello request or by the server
           in response to a client hello after initial handshaking.  Either of
           these would normally lead to renegotiation; when that is not appro-
           priate, the recipient should respond with this alert; at that
           point, the original requester can decide whether to proceed with
           the connection. One case where this would be appropriate would be
           where a server has spawned a process to satisfy a request; the
           process might receive security parameters (key length, authentica-
           tion, etc.) at startup and it might be difficult to communicate
           changes to these parameters after that point. This message is
           always a warning.

       "UK"/"unknown"
           This indicates that no description is available for this alert
           type.  Probably vvaalluuee does not contain a correct alert message.
