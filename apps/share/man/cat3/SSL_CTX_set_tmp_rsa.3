       When using a cipher with RSA authentication, an ephemeral RSA key
       exchange can take place. In this case the session data are negotiated
       using the ephemeral/temporary RSA key and the RSA key supplied and cer-
       tified by the certificate chain is only used for signing.

       Under previous export restrictions, ciphers with RSA keys shorter (512
       bits) than the usual key length of 1024 bits were created. To use these
       ciphers with RSA keys of usual length, an ephemeral key exchange must
       be performed, as the normal (certified) key cannot be directly used.

       Using ephemeral RSA key exchange yields forward secrecy, as the connec-
       tion can only be decrypted, when the RSA key is known. By generating a
       temporary RSA key inside the server application that is lost when the
       application is left, it becomes impossible for an attacker to decrypt
       past sessions, even if he gets hold of the normal (certified) RSA key,
       as this key was used for signing only. The downside is that creating a
       RSA key is computationally expensive.

       Additionally, the use of ephemeral RSA key exchange is only allowed in
       the TLS standard, when the RSA key can be used for signing only, that
       is for export ciphers. Using ephemeral RSA key exchange for other pur-
       poses violates the standard and can break interoperability with
       clients.  It is therefore strongly recommended to not use ephemeral RSA
       key exchange and use EDH (Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman) key exchange
       instead in order to achieve forward secrecy (see
       _S_S_L___C_T_X___s_e_t___t_m_p___d_h___c_a_l_l_b_a_c_k(3)).

       On OpenSSL servers ephemeral RSA key exchange is therefore disabled by
       default and must be explicitly enabled  using the SSL_OP_EPHEMERAL_RSA
       option of _S_S_L___C_T_X___s_e_t___o_p_t_i_o_n_s(3), violating the TLS/SSL standard. When
       ephemeral RSA key exchange is required for export ciphers, it will
       automatically be used without this option!

       An application may either directly specify the key or can supply the
       key via a callback function. The callback approach has the advantage,
       that the callback may generate the key only in case it is actually
       needed. As the generation of a RSA key is however costly, it will lead
       to a significant delay in the handshake procedure.  Another advantage
       of the callback function is that it can supply keys of different size
       (e.g. for SSL_OP_EPHEMERAL_RSA usage) while the explicit setting of the
       key is only useful for key size of 512 bits to satisfy the export
       restricted ciphers and does give away key length if a longer key would
       be allowed.

       The ttmmpp__rrssaa__ccaallllbbaacckk is called with the kkeeyylleennggtthh needed and the
       iiss__eexxppoorrtt information. The iiss__eexxppoorrtt flag is set, when the ephemeral
       RSA key exchange is performed with an export cipher.

       Generate temporary RSA keys to prepare ephemeral RSA key exchange. As
       the generation of a RSA key costs a lot of computer time, they saved
       for later reuse. For demonstration purposes, two keys for 512 bits and
       1024 bits respectively are generated.
