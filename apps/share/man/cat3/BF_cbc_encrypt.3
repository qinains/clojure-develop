       This library implements the Blowfish cipher, which was invented and
       described by Counterpane (see http://www.counterpane.com/blowfish.html
       ).

       Blowfish is a block cipher that operates on 64 bit (8 byte) blocks of
       data.  It uses a variable size key, but typically, 128 bit (16 byte)
       keys are considered good for strong encryption.  Blowfish can be used
       in the same modes as DES (see _d_e_s___m_o_d_e_s(7)).  Blowfish is currently one
       of the faster block ciphers.  It is quite a bit faster than DES, and
       much faster than IDEA or RC2.

       Blowfish consists of a key setup phase and the actual encryption or
       decryption phase.

       _B_F___s_e_t___k_e_y_(_) sets up the BBFF__KKEEYY kkeeyy using the lleenn bytes long key at
       ddaattaa.

       _B_F___e_c_b___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) is the basic Blowfish encryption and decryption func-
       tion.  It encrypts or decrypts the first 64 bits of iinn using the key
       kkeeyy, putting the result in oouutt.  eenncc decides if encryption (BBFF__EENNCCRRYYPPTT)
       or decryption (BBFF__DDEECCRRYYPPTT) shall be performed.  The vector pointed at
       by iinn and oouutt must be 64 bits in length, no less.  If they are larger,
       everything after the first 64 bits is ignored.

       The mode functions _B_F___c_b_c___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_), _B_F___c_f_b_6_4___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) and
       _B_F___o_f_b_6_4___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) all operate on variable length data.  They all take
       an initialization vector iivveecc which needs to be passed along into the
       next call of the same function for the same message.  iivveecc may be ini-
       tialized with anything, but the recipient needs to know what it was
       initialized with, or it won't be able to decrypt.  Some programs and
       protocols simplify this, like SSH, where iivveecc is simply initialized to
       zero.  _B_F___c_b_c___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) operates on data that is a multiple of 8 bytes
       long, while _B_F___c_f_b_6_4___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) and _B_F___o_f_b_6_4___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) are used to
       encrypt an variable number of bytes (the amount does not have to be an
       exact multiple of 8).  The purpose of the latter two is to simulate
       stream ciphers, and therefore, they need the parameter nnuumm, which is a
       pointer to an integer where the current offset in iivveecc is stored
       between calls.  This integer must be initialized to zero when iivveecc is
       initialized.

       _B_F___c_b_c___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) is the Cipher Block Chaining function for Blowfish.
       It encrypts or decrypts the 64 bits chunks of iinn using the key sscchheedd--
       uullee, putting the result in oouutt.  eenncc decides if encryption (BF_ENCRYPT)
       or decryption (BF_DECRYPT) shall be performed.  iivveecc must point at an 8
       byte long initialization vector.

       _B_F___c_f_b_6_4___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) is the CFB mode for Blowfish with 64 bit feedback.
       It encrypts or decrypts the bytes in iinn using the key sscchheedduullee, putting
       the result in oouutt.  eenncc decides if encryption (BBFF__EENNCCRRYYPPTT) or decryp-
       tion (BBFF__DDEECCRRYYPPTT) shall be performed.  iivveecc must point at an 8 byte
       long initialization vector. nnuumm must point at an integer which must be
       initially zero.

       _B_F___o_f_b_6_4___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) is the OFB mode for Blowfish with 64 bit feedback.
       It uses the same parameters as _B_F___c_f_b_6_4___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_), which must be ini-
       tialized the same way.

       _B_F___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) and _B_F___d_e_c_r_y_p_t_(_) are the lowest level functions for Blow-
       fish encryption.  They encrypt/decrypt the first 64 bits of the vector
       pointed by ddaattaa, using the key kkeeyy.  These functions should not be used
       unless you implement 'modes' of Blowfish.  The alternative is to use
       _B_F___e_c_b___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_).  If you still want to use these functions, you should
       be aware that they take each 32-bit chunk in host-byte order, which is
       little-endian on little-endian platforms and big-endian on big-endian
       ones.

       Applications should use the higher level functions _E_V_P___E_n_c_r_y_p_t_I_n_i_t(3)
       etc. instead of calling the blowfish functions directly.
